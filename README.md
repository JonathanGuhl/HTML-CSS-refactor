# - HTML CSS refactor - Horiseon Marketing  

- In this project I have helped deploy and clean up source code for a Marketing Company

- I built this project to help me get a better understanding of HTML formatting, CSS stylesheets, and working within a repository 

- The problem I personally solved in this project was making the source code more readable for another viewer by changing all of the HTML elements to semantic elements as well as adding comments so you can navigate the source code easier without having to dig through all the code 

- I learned the importance of order of operations within the code as well as different little tricks you can use with CSS to make the browser really pop. I understand this a basic webpage, but to me, its alot for just one week of class under my belt.

## Usage 

- Clicking on "Search Engine Optimization" "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing" links in the header will direct you to articles further down the browser.

- Outside of that theres not much usage to this page besides just viewing the information on the browser.

- Here is the link for the website https://jonathanguhl.github.io/JonGuhlModule1-Project/

- The Webpage should look like this when the browser is loaded
